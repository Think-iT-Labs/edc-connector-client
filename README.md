## Abstract

The [**EDC Connector**](https://github.com/eclipse-edc/Connector) is a framework for a sovereign, inter-organizational
data exchange. It provides _low-level_ primitives to allow network participants to expose and consume offers.
The _Connector_ does so by providing an extensive HTTP API documented via
[OpenAPI specification](https://github.com/eclipse-edc/Connector/blob/a6fdb2a0b4360629ec562e11ae19d077162200b7/resources/openapi/openapi.yaml).

This project aims to increase the level of abstraction, bringing the _low-level_ HTTP API to _mid-level_
developers by providing an HTTP Client which is thoroughly tested and fully type-safe.

> Similarly to the **EDC Connector**, this library is at its early stage.
> It aims to maintain compatibility with the latest version of the _Connector_, currently `0.2.1`.
> The compatibility is reflected in the library's versioning.

## Usage

Install via `npm` or `yarn`

```sh
npm install @think-it-labs/edc-connector-client
```

```sh
yarn add @think-it-labs/edc-connector-client
```

Once installed, clients can be instanciated by construcing a `EdcConnectorClient`.

### With internal context

The standard way of using the client would be associating it with a connector,
for doing that it can be instantiated through the `EdcConnectorClient.Builder`

```ts
import { EdcConnectorClient } from "@think-it-labs/edc-connector-client"

const client = new EdcConnectorClient.Builder()
  .apiToken("123456")
  .managementUrl("https://edc.think-it.io/management")
  .publicUrl("https://edc.think-it.io/public")
  .build();
```

At this point the calls can be made against the specified connector:
```ts
const result = await client.management.assets.create({
  asset: {
    properties: {
      "asset:prop:id": "a-http-asset-id",
      "asset:prop:name": "A HTTP asset",
    }
  },
  dataAddress: {
    properties: {
      name: "An HTTP address",
      baseUrl: "https://example.com/",
      type: "HttpData",
      path: "/some-data",
      contentType: "application/json",
      method: "GET",
    },
  },
});
```

### Without internal context

A single connector instance can be used to call multiple connectors, just creating
different contexts and passing them to the specific call.

The connector can be instantiated directly without the builder:
```ts
import { EdcConnectorClient } from "@think-it-labs/edc-connector-client"

const client = new EdcConnectorClient();
```

Context objects can be created with a `createContext` call:
```ts
const context = client.createContext("123456", {
  default: "https://edc.think-it.io/api",
  management: "https://edc.think-it.io/management",
  protocol: "https://edc.think-it.io/protocol",
  public: "https://edc.think-it.io/public",
  control: "https://edc.think-it.io/control",
});
```

And the context can be passed to every call as latest argument:
```ts
const result = await client.management.assets.create(context, {
  asset: {
    properties: {
      "asset:prop:id": "a-http-asset-id",
      "asset:prop:name": "A HTTP asset",
    }
  },
  dataAddress: {
    properties: {
      name: "An HTTP address",
      baseUrl: "https://example.com/",
      type: "HttpData",
      path: "/some-data",
      contentType: "application/json",
      method: "GET",
    },
  },
});
```

## Error handling

All API methods are _type, and error-safe_, which means arguments are fully typed
with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), and thrown errors are always
`EdcConnectorClientError` instances. This error safety level is achieved using the
[`TypedError`](https://github.com/Think-iT-Labs/typed-error) library.

```ts

import { EdcConnectorClientError, EdcConnectorClientErrorType } from "@think-it-labs/edc-connector-client"

try {

  // perform async EdcConnectorClient actions

} catch(error) {
  if (error instanceof EdcConnectorClientError) {
    switch (error.type) {
      case EdcConnectorClientErrorType.Duplicate: {
        // handle duplicate error
      }

      // ...

      case EdcConnectorClientErrorType.Unknown:
      default: {
        // red alert: unknown behaviour
      }
    }
  }
}

```

> **Note** if you encounter an `Unknown` error you should report this behavior
> along steps to reproduce it. `Unknown` behaviors are unwanted and must be fixed asap.

## Development

`docker compose` is used to run the development environment. It runs two
connectors with capabilities described in the
[gradle configuration](connector/build.gradle.kts) file.
