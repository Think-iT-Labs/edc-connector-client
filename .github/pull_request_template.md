<!--

Pull requests are a chance to teach and learn: share the knowledge. With PRs, we
keep track of the features' history of a code-base and – indirectly – we write
documentation.

It is fundamental to ensure new joiners of future endeavors can easily read
through our code choices.

So let's share our learnings.

### Open Questions and Pre-Merge TODOs
<!-- Optional - remove if not necessary

Provide a list of tasks/doubts to clarify if the pull request is still a _draft_ (a.k.a. not ready for review).
